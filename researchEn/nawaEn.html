      <TD> The tonal is everything we see including ourselves and the world. The tonal does not create anything. The tonal only witnesses and evaluates. Like an island in the sea, the tonal is born from the nagual. The tonal begins with our birth, and the tonal ends with our death.

      <TD>The nagual is something that cannot be expressed in words. The nagual is power and  the nagual creates the tonal. When we die, everything, the senses,reality, the self, etc. is dispersed and floats in the nagual.

      <TD>If  we look at ourselves as individuals, there are two points :reason and  will. Reason perceives only the tonal, but will is at the point where both the tonal and the nagual intersect. So, will can perceive both the tonal and the nagual. According to nagualism, will is in the position of the abdomen.
</BR>
When we are born, we are placed in a bubble called the tonal. At first this bubble is open, but as we grow and our reason develops, it gradually begins to close, and eventually we are trapped within it. The bubble is our perception, and what we see within its round walls is ourselves.
</BR>
In order to break out of that tonal bubble, we have to organize our tonal. We must purify our ego-consciousness and attachments within our tonal. Additionally, we need to harmonize our outer appearance with our inner mind. This creates a strong tonal and allows it to shrink easily. When the bubble is opened from the purified side of the tonal, half of the bubble will be occupied by will, not by reason. This gives us two points—both reason and will—allowing us to use the power of will.

According to Nagualism, we and everything around us are emanations of energy. When a sorcerer looks at a human being as energy, the human being appears like an egg-shaped cocoon. On the surface of the cocoon, there is a glowing part called the assemblage point. This point is where the human cocoon and the energy outside the cocoon unite to generate perception.

      <TD>
On rare occasions, this glowing part can move inside the human cocoon, forming what's called the second attention. According to Nagualism, the world is multidimensional, like the skin of an onion. By moving the assemblage point and changing the level of consciousness, another world can be perceived. When the assemblage point moves to the second attention, we become capable of astral projection and perceiving worlds beyond our ordinary reality. We typically deplete our own energy, leaving little in our cocoon, which prevents the assemblage point from shifting to the second attention. However, Nagualism teaches that consistent practice allows energy to be stored in the body's chakras. As you continue practicing, your assemblage point will slowly but steadily move further inside the cocoon, enabling astral projection.

The force that makes the cocoon glow is called intent, or spirit. By storing energy within yourself, you connect with the intent that is deep within the cocoon. With that intent, not just a part of the cocoon but the entire cocoon can glow; this is called the third attention. When we die, our present consciousness is eventually dispersed, and we are destined for reincarnation. However, Nagualism teaches that if we can attain the third attention, we can preserve our present consciousness forever after death in the multidimensional world.

In Nagualism, the term petty tyrant describes a person with strong ego-consciousness and obsession who shows no regard for harming others. It is considered fortunate for a practitioner to encounter a petty tyrant. When faced with one, you must either obey them or gather your own energy and respond strategically. For this reason, a practitioner is compelled by the petty tyrant to employ the art of stalking and accumulate energy within themselves, which ultimately leads to their growth.

These energy lines can be used to open chakras in the abdomen, heart, and head. As the energy lines open the chakras, you can merge the inner energy lines with the astral bodies floating outside the body. In this way, Nagualism explains that astral projection can be achieved and the astral body completed. According to the teachings of Nagualism, by continuing the practice of recapitulation, one is liberated from past attachments, the astral body is constructed, and one gains the ability to do astral projection. Ultimately, one can be liberated from reincarnation.

According to Nagualism, intent is the source of all things and the force that makes the impossible possible. When one is connected to intent, one can use it to realize their desires. To manifest your desires, your connection to intent must be strong. If this connection is strong, you'll be able to use your intent by simply focusing on what you want. First, you command your desire to yourself, then you repeat the command. By repeating it, the command becomes the command of the source of all things—intent—and then the command manifests.

In Nagualism, the training method of stopping the internal dialogue is frequently emphasized. It involves silencing your thoughts for half an hour or an hour to achieve inner silence. In this practice, you must halt your internal dialogue with a strong will, just as you would learn a language. This frees energy from reason, allowing it to be gathered into intent. Since intent is the opposite of reason, it's necessary to stop the internal dialogue and liberate energy from rational thought.

The first abstract core is called the manifestation of the spirit. When the connection between you and intent is activated, the spirit (or intent) can manifest to you through intuition.

The fifth abstract core is called the requirements of intent.

The sixth abstract core is called handling intent. In this stage, if you have sufficient energy, you can connect with intent completely at will.

According to Nagualism, Intent is the force that causes a portion of one's energy emanations to glow, and it is also the force that creates one's perception. By connecting with intent, one can also cause the inner parts of one's energy emanations, which don't normally glow, to illuminate. In this way, one can achieve astral projection and perceive the world of another dimension. Furthermore, by connecting with intent, one can make all parts of one's energy emanations glow. Ultimately, this can lead to liberation from reincarnation.
