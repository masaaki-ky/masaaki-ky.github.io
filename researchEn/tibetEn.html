</br>【Madhyamaka】 Action and misery arise from mental fabrication. However, mental fabrication through language stops when you stop thinking and your mind dissolves into emptiness.When mental fabrication ceases, action and misery  also cease. When action and misery  cease completely, there is Nirvana. 

</br>【Two truths】Nagarjuna does not completely deny language. He then goes on to discuss the two truths.
</br>【The ultimate truth】 the truth that is beyond duality and cannot be explained in words is called ultimate truth. To experience ultimate truth, you have to stop thinking and let your mind dissolve into the emptiness that transcends duality.


</br>【The  conventional truth】 The truth explained in words is called the truth of worldly convention. Just as Buddha used language to teach,language is necessary to explain the truth.
</br>【Middle way】In this way, Nagarjuna explains that both the conventional truth and the ultimate truth are necessary.

</TD>
      <TD></TD>
      <TD>The twelve links are the cycle of suffering known as samsara. Each of the twelve links becomes the cause of the next link.
</br>
</br>【Ignorance】 Ignorance is the unknowing mind that does not understand the truth that attachment is the root of all suffering. 
</br>→【Choices】 Choices are intention regarding, sights, sounds, smells, tastes, touches, and thoughts.
</br>→【Consciousness】 The Buddha stated that consciousness is dependently originated and impermanent and is not the true self.
</br>→【Name-and-form】 Name-and-form refers to mental aggregates and physical body.
</br>→【Six sense fields】 The six sense fields are sense organs including the eyes and ears. 
</br>→【Contact】 Contact is the meeting of the sense organs with their corresponding objects, such as sights, sounds, odors, tastes, and tactile sensations.
</br>→【Feeling】 This includes pleasant, painful, and neutral feelings. 
</br>→【Craving】 Desire and aversion is born.
</br>→【Grasping】We become attached to things.
</br>→【Continued existence】 Continued existence is existence in the material realm, the realm of desire, and the formless realm. This is how karma is accumulated.
</br>→【Rebirth】Through accumulated karma, you are reborn into another body.
</br>→【Old age and death】 In the next life, suffering such as old age and death will be repeated.     
</br>
</br>The Buddha also taught a  practice of eliminating the chain of the twelve links to end suffering.
</br>
</br>You extinguish grasping. Even if things appear enchanting, they will eventually bind you and bring suffering. You observe the drawbacks of the things to which you are attached 
and see them as unwholesome. By extinguishing grasping, the other links are extinguished.
</br>
</br>Furthermore, you extinguish consciousness. Through meditation by neither intending nor planning,  you completely cut off the conditions for the arising of consciousness. In this way by extinguishing consciousness, the other links are extinguished.
</br>
</br>Furthermore, you extinguish choices. By practicing the Eightfold Path, you extinguish karma. The right path that arises from truth does not create karma. By extinguishing choices, other causal links are extinguished.

</br>【The Truth of Suffering】 All existence in this world is suffering. Even worldly pleasures eventually bind the mind and bring about pain.
</br>【The Truth of the Cause of Suffering】 The root cause of suffering is attachment—specifically to desires, fixed concepts, and the ego.
</br>【The Truth of the Cessation of Suffering】 By severing these attachments that cause pain, one can reach the state of Nirvana, which is free from all suffering.
</br>【The Truth of the Path】 The specific method to achieve this is through the practice of the Eightfold Path.

</br>【Right View】 Having the correct understanding based on the Four Noble Truths.
</br>【Right Intention】 Possessing the right will to eliminate suffering and aspire for liberation.
</br>【Right Speech】 Using truthful and wholesome words. Refraining from backbiting, slander, and harsh language.
</br>【Right Action】 Engaging in ethical conduct. Refraining from taking life, stealing, and other harmful acts.
</br>【Right Livelihood】 Earning a living in an honest and ethical way.
</br>【Right Effort】 Making the proper spiritual effort. The Buddha taught the Four Right Exertions as the four aspects of this effort.
</br>【Right Mindfulness】 Maintaining the correct awareness that all things are impermanent. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness were taught as the method for this practice.
</br>【Right Concentration】 Unifying the mind into a single point to make it unshakable. The Four Dhyanas were taught as the process to achieve this.

      <TD>(The practical method of Right Mindfulness within the Eightfold Path.)
</br>　The Buddha teaches the Four Foundations of Mindfulness as a meditation method for shedding the burden of the Five Aggregates. The Four Foundations of Mindfulness consist of four contemplation practices.
</br>【Mindfulness of the Body】 a meditation method where one observes the body as it truly is. One realizes that the physical body is impermanent—it will eventually age and decay. By doing so, one lets go of attachment to the body.
</br>【Mindfulness of Feelings】 a meditation method where one observes feelings as they truly are. One realizes that feelings, even if they seem attractive, generate suffering when clung to. One then lets go of attachment to them.
</br>【Mindfulness of Mind】 a meditation method where one observes the mind as it truly is. Observing one's mind reveals that it arises and ceases, unstable and impermanent. One realizes that the mind, too, is impermanent and without inherent substance.
</br>【Mindfulness of the Dhamma】　the observation of the workings of the mind and the Buddhist teachings that constitute their principle. Through this practice, one comes to understand the principle of Dependent Origination—that all phenomena arise in relation to other factors and are devoid of any inherent, permanent self-essence. Consequently, one cuts off attachment to all things.

   </br>As a result, the mind connects with the truth that lies beyond duality.

</br>To concentrate the mind, one must first detach it from various attachments and worldly desires. Then, through meditation, one progresses step-by-step toward a state of deep inner peace.
</br>【The First Dhyana】First, you enter a state of joy and happiness accompanied by directed thought and evaluation.
</br>【The Second Dhyana】Next, you advance to a state of joy and happiness born of concentration, where thoughts subside.
</br>【The Third Dhyana】Next, the surges of intense joy subside, leaving in their place only a sense of quiet and profound happiness.
</br>【The Fourth Dhyana】Next, one moves into a state where even tranquility fades away, and consciousness becomes exceedingly pure. With this crystal-clear mind, one discerns the ultimate truth.

</TD>
      <TD></TD>
      <TD>In ancient times, the Buddha and his disciples possessed supernatural abilities known as spiritual powers. These powers manifest when one enters a state of deep meditation. The Four Bases of Spiritual Power are four methods of practice used to perfect that state of deep meditation.

</br>【Desire】The source of mental concentration is desire. By cultivating right desire, you can enhance your state of meditative absorption.
 </br>【Effort】The source of mental concentration is energy and effort. By putting in effort, you can enhance your state of meditative absorption.
</br>【Mind】The source of mental concentration is a pure mind, free from wandering thoughts. By avoiding evil or unwholesome states and letting go of attachments, you can control your mind and enhance the power to stay focused on a single point.
</br>【Investigation】The source of mental concentration is a mind connected to the truth. By observing the truth with a focused mind and maintaining that connection, you can further deepen your state of meditative absorption.

</BR>③As a seeker of nirvana, I cannot be bound by wealth and honors. This is why even when others harm them, I feel no anger towards those people.

</BR>④In the practice of patience, an enemy who brings me harm is very important. A teacher cannot give us the opportunity to experience the practice of patience. That is why I believe an enemy is a greater being than a teacher.

This is the practice of joyfully making an effort for the good. 

</BR>Here are four forces needed to practice diligence.
</BR>【The force of aspiration】 It is the force that arises from understanding and being convinced that one's efforts are truly good.

</BR>【The force of steadfastness】 It is the force to complete a practice without giving up. To achieve this, it's important to thoroughly consider whether you can continue the practice before you even start it.

</BR>【The force of Joy】 This is the force to find joy in the effort itself. If the practice is truly good for you, you should feel  joy in the effort itself.

</BR>【The force of relinquishment】 When your strength is exhausted, you temporarily stop and rest. This allows you to practice even better afterward. By doing this, you become skilled in your practice.

Our minds are attached to various things.　And the attachment to the self, in particular, leads to violence, fear, and suffering. To concentrate the mind, you must first free it from the bondage of these attachments.

Dependent origination means that all phenomena lack an inherent, independent existence; they arise only in relation to one another. Similarly, you understand that your own essence is empty of any true substance and that your existence manifests through your relationships with others.

</BR>The wisdom (Prajna) is this understanding of dependent origination.


</p>Furthermore, this is not just a conceptual understanding of emptiness. Instead, you directly experience emptiness through meditation. By completely silencing the ceaselessly searching intellect, you have an insight that transcends thought—the experience of emptiness. This is how you master emptiness.

</BR>When you master emptiness, the mind will no longer be attached to impermanent things. Then, the mind becomes unshakable, enters a state of peace, and suffering ceases.

      <TD>The goal of Tibetan esoteric Buddhism is first to gather the winds into the central channel, and then to bring the winds into the indestructible drop in the heart. Then, when the winds unite with  the indestructible drop completely, the mind, enter into the clear light.  If we compare the mind, central channel, wind, and drop to a carriage, the mind is the rider, the central channel is the road, the wind is the horse, and the drop is the rider's food.




 With the help of the wind, the mind moves through the central channel to the indestructible drop in the heart. and with the help of the drop, the mind can be more closely united with the emptiness.

      <TD>Bliss-void union is the idea that bliss and emptiness are inseparable. It emphasizes that meditating on emptiness alone or bliss alone is insufficient. But emptiness and bliss must be connected. The subjective mind and emptiness, which is beyond duality, do not intersect like milk and water. But through bliss, the mind can realize emptiness. And through bliss, the mind can strengthen the connection between the mind and emptiness.

      <TD>Buddhism explains that things exist in dependence on other things.  And it explains that all things are insubstantial. This is called dependent co-arising. The winds are the vehicle of our mind. And the winds are attached, and bound to people and things outside of you.
And suffering arises from our dependence on things that are insubstantial and impermanent.
Even after the death of the physical body, our mind is still caught in attachment and repeats reincarnation.
First you have to get rid of various attachments. Then the mind, or the wind, is dissolved into the central channel, which is usually hollow. When the wind enters the central channel, the mind approaches emptiness, which transcends the duality of subjectivity and objectivity. And one becomes less attached to things.

Then, hold the breath and compress the winds below the navel, allowing them to enter the central channel, which is normally hollow. Imagine a fire being ignited and burning below the navel by the wind. In addition, by contemplating sexual intercourse with the visualized consort, the fire below the navel burns more and more.The heat of energy melts the white drop in the head. And the white drop drips down through the central channel. The white drop is also called amrita. When the winds enter the central channel, which is usually hollow through the practice of the mystic heat, you can proceed to the other five practices of the Six Yogas of Naropa.

</BR>③Tibetan esoteric Buddhism explains that dreams appear in the throat chakra. Then before going to sleep, concentrate on the red chakra in the throat, and collect the winds in the throat chakra. Then, you can control your dreams by imagining the dreams you wish to see.

And at the time of death, when the mind leaves the body from the top of the head through the central channel, the dead person enters Nirvana and is liberated. Therefore, when death is imminent, PoWa is done. The practitioner meditates on the mind repeatedly diving from the heart to the Pure Land above the head. By doing so, this helps the mind to move through the crown at the time of death.

By meditating on the drop at the lower door of the central channel and keeping the mind on that drop,  the winds flowing in the left and right channels, -that is, the mind- are collected in the central channel. This allows the winds to enter the central channel, which is normally hollow. When the winds enter the central channel, you feel bliss.

</BR>②The next method of practice is the vajra recitation. What the winds manifest at the level of the gross body is the breath. So, the vajra recitation is the practice of consciously manipulating the winds by breathing while chanting the mantra.

      <TD>Dzogchen is a central teaching of the Nyingma school of Tibetan Buddhism.
The founder of the Nyingma school is considered to be Padmasambhava, a great Indian esoteric ascetic. There are many legends about his magical powers. Later, Longchenpa Rabjampa
established the practice system of the Nyingma school. It is a practice system centered on Dzogchen. Dzogchen has three methods of practice: the Semde, the Longde, and the Menngagde.

      <TD>In the practice of Dzogchen, the mind is brought closer to the truth that is deep within the mind. Then pure wisdom and clarity appear in the mind. This is the state of contemplation called rigpa. Conversely, the state of ignorance caused by dualism is called ma rigpa. Keeping the mind in the state of contemplation, called rigpa, is the core of Dzogchen practice.

      <TD>Longchenpa Rabjampa explains that everything manifests from the three aspects of truth: emptiness,clear light, and wisdom.The nature of mind also has these three aspects. This can be explained by comparing the nature of our mind to a mirror. A mirror, being transparent, has the ability to reflect, and because it reflects, it reflects an image. In this way, the aspects of emptiness, clear light, and energy are not separate but interdependent.

      <TD>Rolpa is illustrated by the example of a crystal ball, which, like the mirror, has three aspects. When an object is placed near a crystal ball, the object itself appears to be inside the crystal ball.
In the same way, in Rolpa, the energy of the individual appears as a living image in the eye of the mind.
For example, in the afterlife, the deities one has worshipped in life may appear as if they were real. This is the manifestation of one's energy as Rolpa.

      <TD>Tsal is a manifestation of energy that is our own energy, but it appears as if it is an external energy.
For example, when the sun's rays are reflected off a crystal, a rainbow of rays appears. The primary source of the rainbow light is the crystal itself. Sunlight may be a secondary factor, but it is not the primary cause. This is because the light of the rainbow comes from the crystal.
The real world that we perceive as external is actually the manifestation of our own energy combined with external secondary factors.

      <TD>The Menngagde is the core of Dzogchen.
The practice of the Menngagde includes the practices of Trekcho and Togal.
</BR>【Trekcho】The practice method of Trekcho involves abiding in the state of rigpa. When you enter contemplation and your mind dissolves into emptiness, you feel bliss, and your mind becomes clear. You don't need to make any more effort because this is your original state. You simply relax and stay in that state of rigpa. The goal is to remain in the state of rigpa throughout the day. When you can maintain this state during your waking hours, you're ready for the next step, Togal.
</br>【Togal】The practice of Togal aims to further deepen the state of contemplation and enter the clear light. In Togal, by dissolving the mind into the truth deep within, light becomes visible to the eye. When this light appears, you keep looking at it so that it doesn't move, and then that light increases. Different visions appear within this light, and the increase of light reaches its extreme. Ultimately, all phenomena disappear into the truth that creates them, and the distinction between subjective and objective vanishes.

He explains that lucid dreaming is possible through the Dzogchen practice method. Namkhai Norbu teaches us to remain in the state of rigpa both day and night, emphasizing that night practice is often more effective. First, you should practice entering and remaining in the state of rigpa during the day; if you can't enter it during the day, you won't be able to during sleep. If you can stay in rigpa during sleep, you'll be able to have lucid dreams.

      <TD>First, sleep on your back. If you fall asleep quickly in that position, then lie on your side (for men, sleep on your right side; for women, on your left). Then, firmly visualize a white Tibetan A-letter in your heart. If you fall asleep as soon as you get into the sleeping position, visualize a white A-letter on your forehead instead of your heart.
Begin by clearly visualizing the white A-letter. As the mind gathers around it, slowly relax. While maintaining the feeling that the white "A" is present, allow it to spontaneously appear. Then, without thinking, let your mind dissolve into emptiness and feel bliss. In this way, you enter the state of rigpa before falling asleep. As your practice progresses, you can maintain the state of rigpa even after you fall asleep, which will allow you to maintain awareness in dreams and experience lucid dreams.
When you wake up in the morning, remember the white A-letter. If possible, immediately make the sound "A." This helps connect your daytime and nighttime practice of remaining in the state of rigpa.

Specifically, you may dream of future events and past lives, and even receive teachings in your dreams. Furthermore, by remaining in the state of rigpa during sleep and staying lucid, you'll be able to recognize your dreams as dreams. This will enable you to control them, change them into desired dreams, and even perform astral projection.

      <TD>At the moment of death, the mind and the wind (life energy) gather in the central channel of the body. At that time, the mind approaches the clear light. If the mind can realize the clear light, both the mind and the wind leave the body from the top of the head. Then the mind dissolves into the clear light and is liberated. Otherwise, the mind and wind flow out through other openings like the eyes, mouth, or genitals. You then acquire a bardo body composed of mind and wind. Even in this state, you can achieve liberation if your inherent wisdom awakens and you're able to dissolve into the clear light.

      <TD>If you're not liberated, you'll proceed to the bardo of karmic illusions in your bardo body. During this time, you'll experience awesome, frightening, and terrifying sounds, lights, and rays, which cause great fatigue. Then, various images originally stored in the nature of your mind appear one by one as if they were real.
First, with intense light, the peaceful deities depicted in the mandala appear one by one. Don't be afraid of the intense light; instead, concentrate on it. Realize that these peaceful deities are projections of your own energy. Then, meditate on becoming one with all the light and the peaceful deities. In this way, you'll dissolve into the clear light, acquire a body of light, and be liberated.
If you're unable to attain liberation by then, in the next stage, wrathful, blood-drinking deities will appear one by one. Whatever appears, remember that it's a projection of your own energy. Realize that these illusions are you, and become one with them. In this way, you'll dissolve into the clear light, acquire a body of light, and be liberated.

      <TD></TD>
      <TD>If you're still unable to attain liberation, you'll enter the bardo of rebirth. You'll awaken from the unconsciousness caused by the bardo of karmic illusions, and your intellect will gradually become clearer. With the bardo body, you'll be able to reach your desired location simply by thinking about it. You can also see your hometown and your family. However, the bardo body is bound by karma and is a temporary vehicle on the way to rebirth. Depending on the karma from your previous life, you'll see visions of the next life, such as Heaven, the Human Realm, or Hell.
But even at this stage, the path to liberation remains open through meditation on your own patron deity, emptiness, and clear light. The Tibetan Book of the Dead explains how to "close the door of the womb" to prevent rebirth. If you absolutely must be reborn, you can still choose the "womb door" for your next life by concentrating your mind. Concentrate on being reborn in the human realm or heaven, and focus on being born into a good family with a healthy body.

Even more surprisingly, when we set up instruments to observe the electron's path, two lines appear on the screen instead of an interference pattern. This demonstrates that a quantum possesses the properties of a wave, but when observed, it exhibits particle properties. This is called wave-particle duality.

The electrons don't orbit the nucleus; instead, they cover it like a cloud, existing "here and there" simultaneously. This state is called quantum superposition. The position of the electrons is determined only when they are observed.

Quantum entanglement is a phenomenon in which quanta are strongly bound to each other.
First, in an experiment, a photon of light is split into two photons.
Two photons in this quantum superposition state
are moved to Tokyo and Paris, respectively.

And as soon as a photon is observed, the both photons are immediately determined from the superposition state to the particle state:
Whenever one particle is measured to be spinning up, the other is always found to be spinning down. Whenever one particle is measured to be spinning down, the other is always found to be spinning up.
